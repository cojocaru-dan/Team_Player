# team-player

### This is a team project. I work together with Ionut and Laura.

### Together we work on complex nested objects and arrays to add, modify or retrieve some information from these objects/arrays.

We have three objects representing members of this team and we perform algorithmic operations to:
- add properties to each member
- delete properties from each member
- calculate statistical elements
- find members based on specific properties
- create objects based on members data
